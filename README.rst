Python package for running multimodal madness experiments with BMM

* Free software: 3-clause BSD license
* Documentation: (COMING SOON!) https://NSLS-II-PDF.github.io/mmm-experiments.

Developer Instructions
----------------------
For the sanity of your friends and colleagues, please install
pre-commit too keep your code black, flaked, and imports sorted.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/NSLS-II-PDF/mmm-experiments
    cd mmm-experiments
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    pre-commit install

Beamline Origins and Args
-------------------------

===
BMM
===
- Origin for Ti: [155.381, 82.169].
- Range of sample is from X=X0-30 to X0+23
- Ti detector position for xafs_det is 20.
- The Ti rich side is in the negative direction

- Origin for Cu: [155.390, 83.96].
- Range of sample is from X=X0-30 to X0+23
- Cu detector position for xafs_det is 205.
- The Ti rich side is in the negative direction



Setting up Tiled Access
-----------------------
- `data/local_mmm_config.yml` goes in `~/.config/tiled/profiles` or `./venv/etc/tiled/profiles`
- `data/bmm_patches.py` goes in `~/.config/tiled/` or `./venv/etc/tiled/`
- `data/make_tiled_links.sh` goes in `~/.config/tiled/` or `./venv/etc/tiled/`
- Execute make_tiled_links.sh from the tiled directory to create a set of soft links.
- Access needs to be opened up on the machine, a la: https://github.com/NSLS2/ansible/pull/925

Checking with python:

.. code-block:: python

    from tiled.client import from_profile
    from tiled.profiles import list_profiles
    list_profiles()
    catalog = from_profile("bmm")
    catalog = from_profile("bmm_bluesky_sandbox")
    catalog = from_profile("pdf_bluesky_sandbox")

Running with a local mongo
--------------------------
- Following instructions here: https://www.mongodb.com/compatibility/docker
- `data/testing_config.yml` goes in `~/.config/tiled/profiles` or `./venv/etc/tiled/profiles`
    - This file goes to similar locations on the remote machine running the agents on the science network.

In terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run --name mongodb -d -v /tmp/databroker:/data/db -p 27017:27017 mongo


Checking in python:

.. code-block:: python

    from tiled.client import from_profile
    from tiled.profiles import list_profiles
    from event_model import compose_run
    list_profiles()
    catalog = from_profile("testing_sandbox")
    run_bundle = compose_run(uid=None, time=None, metadata=None)
    catalog.v1.insert("start", run_bundle.start_doc)
    uid = run_bundle.start_doc["uid"]
    catalog["uid"]
    # Should output something like <BlueskyRun set() scan_id=UNSET uid='6201900e' 2022-06-30 12:49>


With mongo db live in docker, the `data/example_data.py` script will show how to write into the
database with some dummy data.


Qserver Notes
-------------
On srv1 to launch and perform simple work. The RE manager is launched by systemd.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate $BS_ENV
    qserver environment open
    qserver status
    qserver queue add plan '{"name": "mv", "args":["xafs_x", 50, "xafs_y", 125]}' # Dumb plan, check numbers
    qserver queue start
    qserver environment close


Some example tests using the API are shown here:
https://gist.github.com/dmgav/87dc6c2f7b0bb5775afb5e1277176850


=================
Adding a new plan
=================

In :code:`/nsls2/data/TLA/shared/config/bluesky/profile_collection/startup`, adjust :code:`user_group_permissions.yaml`
to include :code:`':^agent_'` in user_groups:root:allowed_plans.

`qserver permissions get` should show this.

Adding a plan to a start up file (like :code:`def agent_test_plan()` in :code:`99-agent_plans.py`),
then closing the qserver environment, and updating :code:`existing_plans_and_devices.yaml` using  the CLI
will make the plan available. The following commands as the operator account should update the accesible plans.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/.ipython/profile_qs/startup
    unset SUDO_USER # A quirk of BMM's dependence on larch
    qserver environment close
    qserver status
    qserver-list-plans-devices --startup-dir . # updates existing_plans_and_devices.yaml
    qserver environment open
    # Check exiting plans
    qserver existing plans
    qserver status
    # waiting for  'worker_environment_exists': True, 'worker_environment_state': 'idle'}
    # The following line is sometimes necessary...
    qserver permissions reload
    # Check the new plan is allowed
    qserver allowed plans


If only the contents of a plan change, but not the signature of the plan itself,
the environement only needs to be closed and re-opened. This saves some time when gently tweaking plans.

===================
Launching a monitor
===================
- Activate overlay (<tla>_mmm.sh)
- QSERVER_HTTP_SERVER_API_KEY=... queue-monitor --http-server-uri https://qserver.nsls2.bnl.gov/<tla>

Dealing with PDF Analyzed data
------------------------------

To start the zmq -> kafka / mongo bridge
:code: `python -m mmm_experiments.data.zmq_bridge`
in an env where the package is installed.
This will publish to the topic pdf.bluesky.pdfstream.documents and insert into the pdf_bluesky_sandbox databroker.
To work this strips out the two images from the pdfstream data stream.

Set up Overlays
---------------
We need overlays all over the place.
On the workstations for some recent bluesky-widgets and queserver packages for queuemonitor (gui monitor).
And on tritium for training models and deploying agents.

1. create /nsls2/data/{tla}/shared/config/bluesky_overlay/multi-modal-madness
2. pip install stuff into this prefix with no dependencies. :code:`pip install {package} --prefix {overlay_directory} --upgrade -I --no-dependencies --no-build-isolation`
    - bluesky-queueserver
    - bluesky-queueserver-api
    - git+https://github.com/bluesky/bluesky-widgets@60a461659611387b18eee9b84c6a9b22c22df113
3. Give pdf/bmm a multi-modal-madness.sh to run that activates $BS_ENV and extends the PYTHONPATH to include this overlay.
4. Create an venv for tritium in a local project using venv: :code:`python -m venv venv; conda deactivate; source venv/bin/activate; pip install --upgrade pip`
5. Clone and navigate to mmm-experiments repository, and :code:`pip install -e .`
6. :code:`pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu113`
    - This is specific to tritium's needs w.r.t hardware.



Running List of Gripes/Complaints/Bugs/Suggested Improvements
-------------------------------------------------------------
- The way the agent inserts documents into db accesses too many private attributes.
    - This is either the wrong way to do things, or the right way doesn't exist yet.
- Security of the queue. Agents need to be able to start the queue, but this creates a safety issue for beamline emergencies.
    - Our current strategy is that the beamline scientist controls the state of the queue-server environment.
    - The agents are then allowed to try and start/stop the queue.
    - An emergency stop inolves pausing the current plan. Aborting the plan. Closing the environment.
- Currently efforts have been put forward to use conditionals to avoid errors in queue/http server. In production version all exceptions including communication timeout exceptions should be properly processed, but this may work fine for this experiment.
- Everything to run builder must be a list for event streams. Becuse everything is going through event page whether you like it or not.
- Adding plans changes detector exposure time at PDF. This is likely a design problem with BSUI and PDF's profile.
- The operator account's home directory is not shared between the srv1 VM and the workstations. This was an issue for BMM's plans that reference a file in the home dir.
    - Bruce's scheme for knowing where to write data was not working on a fresh machine that had never seen the BMMuser.start_experiment() command run by hand in bsui
    - Bruce has a spreadsheet that doesn't get cleared effectively after other experiments, and the plan will look for something that doesn't exist because the "instrument" argument was set.
    - There was also cross talk of state between files and redis, so clearing one could sometimes have no effect.
- We need a helper in queueserver to get into an ipython shell and poke around, or an ipython kernel from that namespace. This would have helped with debugging the above (which took hours...).
- Starting up bsui or qserver env can change the detector frame-rate at PDF which can confuse existing bsui sessions. This is a problem with state management at PDF.
- Nohuped agents should be killed with signit. `kill -s SIGINT <PID>`
- Passive queue monitor agents are necessary to alert for failures over night, potentially restart queue, etc. (Separate from decision making agents)
- The PDF agent during a long experiment failed because it stopped receiving stop documents.
    - pdfstream -> kafka+mongo bridge saturated a local hard disk, and stopped issuing messages to kafka.
- XCA agents should have classes rigidly/reproducibly ordered and retained.
